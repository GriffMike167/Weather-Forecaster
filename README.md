<h1>Welcome to the Weather</h1>
<p>Here we have an app that tells you the weather in any city you choose! Traveling soon and need to know what to pack, wanna see how to dress for school? its all here, enter the city and get current and a five day forecast.</p>


<p>To do this we referenced the Open Weather Api. We used this to tie in the information we need to get the information you need! We tracked the UV index as you enter the destination it pulls the longitude and latitude to give us to track down this information. You can also quickly reference any place you searched before as it is stored below the search input.</p>
